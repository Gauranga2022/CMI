Files**\n","\n","-   **Sorting**: Think of sorting as arranging your data in a particular order. For BAM/SAM files, this usually means ordering the reads based on their position in the genome. This makes it easier to find and analyze specific regions in your data.\n","-   **Merging**: If you have multiple files containing parts of your data, merging them combines all these parts into a single, complete file. This is useful when you have data from different experiments or runs and want to analyze them together.\n","\n","### 2\\. **Marking Duplicates**\n","\n","-   During sequencing, sometimes the same piece of DNA gets copied multiple times. Picard can find these duplicate copies and mark them. By marking duplicates, you can ignore them in your analysis, so your results aren't skewed by counting the same piece of DNA more than once.\n","\n","### 3\\. **Collecting Quality Metrics**\n","\n","-   Picard can check the quality of your sequencing data by calculating various statistics. For example, it can tell you the average size of DNA fragments, how well your reads align to the reference genome, and if there are any unusual patterns. This helps ensure your data is good enough for further analysis.\n","\n","### 4\\. **File Conversion**\n","\n","-   Picard can change the format of your data files. For example, it can switch between BAM (a compressed, efficient format) and SAM (a plain-text version) formats. This is helpful when different tools require different formats.\n","\n","### 5\\. **Manipulating Headers**\n","\n","-   The header of a BAM/SAM file contains important information about the data, like the sample name and sequencing details. Picard allows you to change this information, such as adding new details or correcting mistakes, so that your files have accurate and complete metadata."],"metadata":{"id":"CxSj7t6KNl5c"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Picard is a Java-based tool, so you need to install Java first."],"metadata":{"id":"7mWOaFW3S23I"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"dEMmyItfNowl","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1728655936576,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Gauranga Kumar Baishya","userId":"09042457344042071897"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["You can download the Picard JAR file from the official Broad Institute website."],"metadata":{"id":"sYatRm2uTaYC"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!wget -O picard.jar https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/releases/download/2.27.4/picard.jar"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"8-7KJha3S414","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1728655936576,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Gauranga Kumar Baishya","userId":"09042457344042071897"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!java -jar picard.jar SortSam \\\n","    INPUT=/content/aligned_reads.bam \\\n","    OUTPUT=/content/sorted_reads.bam \\\n","    SORT_ORDER=coordinate"],"metadata":{"id":"lhFjVWarTT76","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1728655936577,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Gauranga Kumar Baishya","userId":"09042457344042071897"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Key Points in the Log:\n","\n","1.  **Command Line Syntax Change Notification**:\n","\n","    -   Picard is notifying you that the command line syntax is changing.
